    Unveiling a Journey:
  </h3>
  <p>My career path has been as diverse as it has been enlightening. Serving in the RAAF, I navigated the complexities of military life while finding solace in teaching and technology. From the challenges of loading telex machines to deciphering the enigma of the infamous ration pack, I thrived on problem-solving and illuminating the path forward for those around me.</p>
  <h3>A Turning Point: </h3>
  <p>The year 2000 marked a pivotal moment in my life. I bid farewell to the RAAF and embarked on a 14-year journey in vocational education, specializing in web design and development. It was a chapter dedicated to finding healing and meaning, as I guided eager learners with meticulous precision, witnessing their growth and evolution.</p>
  <h3>The Quest for Healing and Discovery:</h3>
  <p>In 2015, I took another transformative step, intertwining the wisdom of Adler and the Stoics into my personal odyssey of healing and self-discovery. Through Codemaster Institute bootcamps, I found a platform to inspire and empower aspiring web enthusiasts, igniting their passion for the digital realm.</p>

  <p>Today, my commitment to education and personal growth is stronger than ever. I venture into the digital frontier to empower individuals like you with the skills and knowledge to thrive in the vast landscape of web technologies. Through every thread I knit and website I develop, I showcase the transformative power of web technologies.</p>
